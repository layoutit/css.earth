# M60

A survey image of M60 (NGC 4649), cleaned of the Milky Way stars in front of it and color-tied to its measured integrated color, stands on a flat plane facing the Sun. Image brightness does not measure per-pixel distance.

| [Sloan Digital Sky Survey](https://www.sdss.org/) | [Record](../../sources/sdss-dr9-color-hips.json). The survey's g, r, i color composite as the CDS HiPS `CDS/P/SDSS9/color`, cut out by the CDS hips2fits service: 3000 × 3000 px over 10.86 × 10.86 arcmin, tangent projection, north up (`source/source.jpg`, restored from its origin). A display composite, not calibrated photometry. |

## The image

- **Registration:** the cutout's registration is its request: a tangent projection centred on the galaxy, north up.
- **Foreground stars:** the bake removes the Gaia foreground stars where they show and leaves those on extended light.
- **Color:** tied to RC3's B-V of 0.97 in linear light.
- **Plane:** the picture's own tangent plane, perpendicular to the sight line, so it faces the Sun. It has no disc to lay the picture on. This is where a sky picture lies, not a measured shape.
- **Rim:** the picture fades out on a round rim at 25.78 kpc, 0.98 of its half-width, so no straight edge shows.
- **Sky:** the image's sky, (17, 13, 9) of 255 (each channel's median over the frame's outer ring), is subtracted as the background floor (17 of 255).

## Known problems

- The picture is flat: seen from the side it is a line.
- The survey image is shallow: faint outer light is lost, and the brightest part of the centre may be saturated.
- Fainter and uncatalogued foreground stars remain.
