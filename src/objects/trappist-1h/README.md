# TRAPPIST-1h

The [navigation marker](source/preparation/navigation.json) adds a prepared curvature cue to the existing neutral gray placeholder. It remains a schematic identifier without resolved surface imagery; the shading is a display convention, not measured limb darkening or surface detail.

## Sources

TRAPPIST-1h is the outermost and smallest of the seven planets of [TRAPPIST-1](../trappist-1/README.md), an ultracool dwarf 12.47 parsecs away. Every number in this
package comes from Agol et al. (2021, PSJ 2, 1), who fitted the seven planets' transit times and the Spitzer and ground-based photometry together: the
planets perturb each other enough for their masses to be read from the timing of their transits.

**Size and mass.** 0.755 Earth radii and 0.326 Earth masses (Agol et al. (2021, PSJ 2, 1), Table 6), a density of 0.755 Earth's and a
surface gravity of 0.570 Earth's. The radius comes from the transit depth against the star's own radius; the mass from the
transit-timing variations, scaled by the stellar mass Mann et al. (2019) give.

**Orbit.** 18.7682 days at 0.06189 au, 0.144 times the starlight Earth receives (Agol et al. (2021, PSJ 2, 1), Tables 2, 5 and 6). The
scene draws a circle: the paper's eccentricity for this planet, 0.00365, moves it by up to 7.0 of its own radii, and is not drawn. The
period and transit time are the ones the Agol et al. (2024, arXiv:2409.11620) forecast gives around the scene epoch
(2026-09-03), which adds JWST timings to the Agol et al. (2021) model; their Table 2 period, 18.772866 d, is an osculating value at
the start of their simulation and drifts hours off by 2026. Transit-timing variations of -18.8 to +22.9 minutes about that
line are not modelled. The orbit's position
angle on the sky is not measured, so the ascending node is drawn at celestial north, a stated convention.

**Rotation.** Assumed synchronous: this close to its star the planet is expected to be tidally locked, and no rotation period of
TRAPPIST-1h is measured. Longitude 0 faces the star.

**What is not here.** No image, colour or map of this planet exists. The sphere is the shared neutral gray of an unresolved
surface, lit by its own star at the measured orbit, and the page says so.

**Illustration lens.** NASA's artist's concept of TRAPPIST-1h: the map its [Eyes on Exoplanets](https://eyes.nasa.gov/apps/exo/) app wraps around the planet ([`TRAPPIST-1_h.jpg`](https://eyes.nasa.gov/apps/exo/assets/image/exoplanet/TRAPPIST-1_h.jpg), 2,048 × 1,024, named in the app's texture table), credited NASA/JPL-Caltech. NASA says each planet in the app shows "an artist's concept of what it might look like" ([tutorial](https://science.nasa.gov/tutorials/eyes-on-exoplanets-tutorial/)); the file carries no credit or date of its own, and NASA does not say how it was made. Nobody has resolved this planet's disc, so none of the colour, clouds or terrain in the map was observed. Preparation resizes it unchanged onto the sphere with its left edge at 0° longitude ([`equirectangular-illustration`](../../../tools/objects/observation/interpret.mts)), so its longitudes are arbitrary. It is a second lens: Shape stays the default. It is listed in the package's illustration lenses, so it never counts as imagery. An earlier TRAPPIST-1 set, NASA/JPL-Caltech maps made for NOAA's [Science On a Sphere](https://sos.noaa.gov/catalog/datasets/exoplanet-trappist-1h/) in March 2017, is different artwork and is not used; this package uses the map NASA's app shows today.

## Evidence

- Run of 2026-09-24: `node tools/prepare/prepare-object.mts` added the Illustration lens; every image this package already delivered is byte-identical to main's. [`equirectangular-illustration.test.mts`](../../../tools/objects/observation/equirectangular-illustration.test.mts) checks that the map keeps its left edge at 0° and that an emissive body gets transparent plates. In headless Chrome the lens opens on the map with no console errors ([all ten planets](../../../docs/images/eyes-on-exoplanets-illustrations.webp)).

- [`source.test.mts`](https://github.com/layoutit/css.earth/blob/943c34c8bac83509725d55ab91b48832fd65a4e8/tests/objects/unit/trappist-1/source.test.mts) checks the pins, and that the planet turns synchronously
  with longitude 0 on its star and orbits it;
  [`hostedOrbits.test.ts`](../../../packages/astronomy/src/hostedOrbits.test.ts) checks that it transits at the published times.
- [`object-systems.test.mts`](../../../site/test/object-systems.test.mts) checks that the TRAPPIST-1 system holds all seven planets.
- Driven in a real browser: the seven orbits and labels draw around the star in the system view, and this planet's page opens on a
  lit sphere of the measured radius.

## Known problems

**No heat of this planet has been detected.** Cartigny et al. (2026, [arXiv:2608.18626](https://arxiv.org/abs/2608.18626)) searched the archival JWST MIRI data of TRAPPIST-1 for the outer planets' combined emission and could not reach the precision to detect it.

**No observation of the planet itself is shown.** Size, mass and orbit are measured; the surface is not. JWST has measured the
mid-infrared dayside brightness of TRAPPIST-1b and c (shown with those planets); this project has reduced no JWST observation of this planet.

**The orbit is circular here.** The measured eccentricity is small but not zero, and the transit-timing variations the masses come
from are not drawn.

**The Illustration lens is art, not data.** Its colours, clouds and terrain are the artist's, and its longitudes are arbitrary; it is shown as NASA published it, with no colour corrected.
