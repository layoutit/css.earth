# Kepler-452

Kepler-452 is a Sun-like star about 554 parsecs away, 1.11 times the Sun’s radius. Its planet Kepler-452 b circles it every 385 days.

## Sources

Source selections, recorded trials and open questions are in the [investigation ledger](investigations.json).

Placement: the SIMBAD position, proper motion and radial velocity with the references SIMBAD gives, and the distance from the Gaia EDR3 parallax 1.8053 ± 0.0103 mas via SIMBAD. Kepler-452 has no Hipparcos number, so it matches no entry of the shared star field; the package places it from the astrometry above.

Radius: Stellar radius 1.11 (+0.15/−0.09) solar radii from Jenkins et al. 2015, AJ 150, 56 (2015). It is a radius from stellar characterisation, not an interferometric diameter; the angular diameter in the record is that radius at the Gaia distance.

Rotation: no spin axis or rotation period is adopted The display axis is celestial north at the star, a convention.

Colour lens: The colour of Gaia DR3's measured spectrum of Kepler-452. Its samples from 380 to 780 nm are weighted by the CIE 1931 2° observer and converted to sRGB with the D65 white, brightest channel full ([stellar-photometric-color.mts](../../../tools/objects/observation/stellar-photometric-color.mts)): **#ffece1**. The file, how it is read and the full citation are in [stellar-color.json](source/photometry/stellar-color.json). The disc is darkened toward its edge by the quadratic V-band law that Claret & Bloemen (2011, A&A 529, A75) compute from ATLAS model atmospheres, read at 5757 K and log g 4.36: the edge is 28% as bright as the centre. That law is a model, not a measurement of this star. Gravity: log g from the astronomy record's GM and radius (physicalNotes), log10(GM/R^2) in cgs. The catalogue swatch, the minimap and the navigation marker use the same colour. [stellar-spectra/author.mts](../../../tools/objects/source-authoring/stellar-spectra/author.mts) writes the colours from these inputs, and `--check` recomputes them. Cross-check: LAMOST DR11 spectrum 247708059 (2014-09-13, relative calibration) gives #fff4eb, 10 levels from the lens colour in its most different channel (the threshold for agreement is 12).


## Evidence

Run of 2026-09-21 (this version):

- [`object-package-consistency.test.mts`](../../../tools/object-package-consistency.test.mts) checks that the catalogue colour #ffece1 is the colour lens's prepared colour and that the limb-darkening law is read at the recorded temperature and gravity; `node tools/objects/source-authoring/stellar-spectra/author.mts --check` recomputes the colour and marker from the pinned spectrum.

## Known problems

The radius comes from stellar characterisation, not from a resolved disc. No image of the surface exists. The star is drawn as a neutral sphere.
