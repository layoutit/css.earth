# Máni

Formerly 2002 MS4, Máni has an outline measured through many stellar occultations. One event revealed a large depression along its edge, but its global terrain and three-dimensional shape remain unresolved.

## Sources

The silhouette-constrained oblate approximation represents the observed **824 × 770 km** projected ellipse with full axes **824 × 824 × 770 km**. The **Shape model** uses the normal unmapped-surface grid. Shadows defaults off.

The source survey was checked on **2026-09-09**. [Measurements and assumptions](source/measurements.json) retain the numerical extraction; the [source manifest](source/manifest.json) pins the files and their acquisition records. See [NOTICE.md](NOTICE.md) for credits and reuse terms.

## Evidence

The original reports and images below are retained at [commit `5ccf1ea`](https://github.com/layoutit/cssEarth/tree/5ccf1eafa396d7cbe91e62b28fe81db8c0626a35/docs/distant-worlds), in their historical `docs/distant-worlds/` location. The PR #99 documentation consolidation and helper relocation reuse them because this body’s measurements, prepared assets and shared runtime bytes are unchanged. These are the original runs, not new captures.

- [Package qualification](https://github.com/layoutit/cssEarth/blob/5ccf1eafa396d7cbe91e62b28fe81db8c0626a35/docs/distant-worlds/qualification.json#L244) recorded **480 native `u` raster triangles** and complete source/runtime byte sets. [Fresh source restoration](https://github.com/layoutit/cssEarth/blob/5ccf1eafa396d7cbe91e62b28fe81db8c0626a35/docs/distant-worlds/fresh-sources.json#L111) verified **20 files**; checked-in inputs were copied and pinned upstream originals downloaded or reused from a freshly verified download. [Fresh runtime installation](https://github.com/layoutit/cssEarth/blob/5ccf1eafa396d7cbe91e62b28fe81db8c0626a35/docs/distant-worlds/fresh-install.json#L1528) checked all **31 assets** for this body against their byte counts and SHA-256 pins. These are closure and acquisition checks, not a claim of output reproduction.
- [Production browser checks](https://github.com/layoutit/cssEarth/blob/5ccf1eafa396d7cbe91e62b28fe81db8c0626a35/docs/distant-worlds/browser-validation.json#L293) recorded the default model at **DPR 1 and 2**, with 480 triangles, Shadows and Orbit off, and no forbidden scene leaves. The run used headless Chromium **152.0.7977.84**, a **1440 × 900** viewport and freshly installed assets on **2026-09-10**. Inspect the [original default-view screenshot](https://github.com/layoutit/cssEarth/blob/5ccf1eafa396d7cbe91e62b28fe81db8c0626a35/docs/distant-worlds/images/mani.webp) and its [image provenance](https://github.com/layoutit/cssEarth/blob/5ccf1eafa396d7cbe91e62b28fe81db8c0626a35/docs/distant-worlds/image-provenance.json). The image shows the selected scientific model, not a resolved photograph.
- [Independent orbital comparison](https://github.com/layoutit/cssEarth/blob/5ccf1eafa396d7cbe91e62b28fe81db8c0626a35/docs/distant-worlds/orbit-errors.json#L131) differed from the retained Horizons vector by **0.0124 m** at the scene epoch; the larger checked ±30-day difference was **523.8 km**. The fixed-epoch osculating two-body orbit does not simulate long-term perturbations.
- [Surface-fit sampling](https://github.com/layoutit/cssEarth/blob/5ccf1eafa396d7cbe91e62b28fe81db8c0626a35/docs/distant-worlds/surface-fit.json#L180) found a maximum radial deviation of **13.5 km** from the adopted ellipsoid over **3,360** vertex, edge-midpoint and triangle-centroid samples. This finite sampling is neither an exhaustive surface-error bound nor a measurement uncertainty.
- [Production search interactions](https://github.com/layoutit/cssEarth/blob/5ccf1eafa396d7cbe91e62b28fe81db8c0626a35/docs/distant-worlds/final-interactions.json) passed both “Máni” and “2002 MS4” aliases.

## Known problems

Equal equatorial depth and an equator-on view are assumptions; true flattening may be larger. The pole is illustrative (right ascension **0°**, declination **90°**) and the meridian arbitrary. An occultation position angle does not determine an inertial spin pole. The local depression is not extruded into invented global relief. The grid marks unmapped terrain.

The [shared checks](https://github.com/layoutit/cssEarth/blob/5ccf1eafa396d7cbe91e62b28fe81db8c0626a35/docs/distant-worlds/checks.json) retain the outstanding `packages/astronomy/src/bodies.ts` max-lines lint failure. The scoped results above do not establish a full-suite pass.

<summary>Preparation and records to change</summary>

The [shared distant-worlds methods](../../../tools/objects/source-authoring/distant-worlds/README.md) explain numerical authoring, acquisition, preparation and the checks above. The existing terrestrial preparer and meshoptimizer turn the adopted analytical ellipsoid into retained PolyCSS native `u` raster triangles; runtime consumes the prepared result.

Edit source interpretation in [measurements](source/measurements.json) and the existing [preparation records](source/preparation/). Trace the generated result through prepared provenance (`prepared/provenance.json`) and the [runtime asset inventory](inventory.json). Common installation and usage belong in the [body contributor guide](../README.md).
