# 153P/Ikeya–Zhang

The navigation snapshot uses the same retained shape and viewing direction, with prepared full-phase lighting (35% ambient, 65% diffuse). Its neutral gray material remains a display convention without observed surface detail. The snapshot recipe is recorded in [the source manifest](source/manifest.json); the selected-body geometry and scientific assets are unchanged.

Shape-only views use the shared neutral gray (#808080 sRGB). This is a display convention, not a measurement of surface color or albedo; gaps within photographic and scientific datasets retain the missing-data grid.

Ikeya–Zhang brightened the skies in 2002. Its journey around the Sun takes centuries, unlike the frequent returns of comets such as Encke.

One **Shape approximation** dataset shows a sphere at an assumed radius of 1.877 km; no published nucleus size exists. The whole surface carries the missing-imagery grid. Shadows defaults off.

| --- | --- |
| [Shape parameters](source/shape/model.json) | An assumed display radius; no published nucleus size exists (see the ledger). |

[Selection, alternatives and assumptions](source/reference/source-record.json) explain the sources and factsheet derivations. [Credits and reuse terms](NOTICE.md) accompany the pinned inputs.

[Investigation ledger](investigations.json) records source choices, failed trials and conditions for retrying. Earlier findings were carried forward from the linked records; this is not a fresh archive search.

## Evidence

Run of 2026-09-16 (this version): `node tools/objects/dist/prepare-authored.js comet-153p --write` prepared the package from the ellipsoid parameters. `node --test tests/objects/unit/comet-radius-models.test.mts` passes for all twenty radius-model comets: the prepared 800-triangle surface is closed, matches the published radius and elongation in its own anchor table and in `packages/astronomy`, carries the missing-imagery grid with Shadows off, and the source manifest verifies. The earlier source, delivery and browser reports tested the retired Celestia mesh and were removed with it.

## Known problems

The ellipsoid is a smooth approximation at a published effective radius, not a measured nucleus reconstruction. No published nucleus size was found; the displayed radius is an assumption carried from the earlier catalogue estimate and is not a measurement. No surface imagery, measured pole, rotation period, current phase, tail or coma is represented. The fixed attitude is illustrative.

Position is fixed at the explorer's epoch; nearby conics are placement approximations, not long-term ephemerides or outgassing predictions. Horizons TDB differs from the stated TT epoch by less than 2 ms.

<summary>Shape preparation</summary>

The published effective radius scales a subdivided octahedron with the stated axis ratios as a volume-equivalent ellipsoid, in metres, reduced offline to 800 display triangles. The camera uses the same radius. Geometry, grid texels, optional shadows and lighting are prepared once; the browser performs no runtime mesh work.
