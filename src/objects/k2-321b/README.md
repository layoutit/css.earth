# K2-321 b

## Sources

It is the only planet known around K2-321. Its orbit and size follow Thygesen et al. 2023's fit, the archive's default. The introduction is generated from Thygesen et al. 2023's published values; the sections below are the data's own.

**Size and mass.** Radius 0.183 Jupiter radii from Thygesen et al. 2023 (2023AJ....165..155T), via the NASA Exoplanet Archive (https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023AJ....165..155T/abstract): 13,083 km at 71,492 km per Jupiter radius. GM from the mass 0.0153 Jupiter masses (the NASA Exoplanet Archive's calculated value (M-R relationship, its Chen & Kipping 2017 mass-radius relationship): a model, not a measurement, via the NASA Exoplanet Archive, https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/pscp_calc.html) times JPL's Jupiter GM. A sphere: no oblateness is measured.

**Orbit.** Thygesen et al. 2023 (2023AJ....165..155T), via the NASA Exoplanet Archive ps table (pl_refname THYGESEN_ET_AL__2023): P 2.2979749 d Thygesen et al. 2023 (2023AJ....165..155T), via the NASA Exoplanet Archive ps table (pl_refname THYGESEN_ET_AL__2023): a/R* 10.25; Thygesen et al. 2023 (2023AJ....165..155T), via the NASA Exoplanet Archive ps table (pl_refname THYGESEN_ET_AL__2023): inclination 86.1 degrees Thygesen et al. 2023 (2023AJ....165..155T), via the NASA Exoplanet Archive ps table (pl_refname THYGESEN_ET_AL__2023): e 0.44 Thygesen et al. 2023 (2023AJ....165..155T), via the NASA Exoplanet Archive ps table (pl_refname THYGESEN_ET_AL__2023): omega 45 degrees Thygesen et al. 2023 (2023AJ....165..155T), via the NASA Exoplanet Archive ps table (pl_refname THYGESEN_ET_AL__2023): transit mid-time 2458141.26759 BJD, taken as BJD_TDB; with its period, the row that predicts 2026-01-01 best (1 sigma 3 min) Display convention: transit photometry does not measure the orbit's position angle on the sky, so the ascending node is set at position angle 0 (celestial north).

**Color.** No image or measured color exists. The neutral gray is lit by k2-321's measured color (#ffc48d, the color dataset of k2-321 (src/objects/k2-321/source/photometry/stellar-color.json)) at the gray's own brightness.

**Charts.** The orbits of K2-321's planets from above, from their hosted-orbit records, and its transit in 3 TESS sectors (45, 46, 72), folded onto its orbit. Upper limits and rows without an error are left out.

## Evidence

Generated 2026-09-29 by [new-object-cli.mts](../../../packages/telescope-cli/src/new-object/new-object-cli.mts); the orbit is the one recorded in [its astronomy record](../../../packages/astronomy/data/bodies/k2-321b.json).

## Known problems

- **Orbit convention.** omega 45 degrees is taken as Thygesen et al. 2023 gives it through the archive (pl_orblper); papers differ on whether that is the star's or the planet's argument of periastron. The epoch is the transit, so a swapped convention would only mirror the ellipse (e 0.44) about the line of sight.
